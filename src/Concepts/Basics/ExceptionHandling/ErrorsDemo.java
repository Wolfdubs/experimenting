3 types:
    Compiler - syntax errors, as compiler cannot translate illegal src into bytecode
    Runtime - syntactically legal code that doesnt work semantically e.g. Arithmetic Errors for 5/0. StackOverflow error where computer runs out of
        memory for the program so terminates early
    Logical - errors in program logic, no easy solutions.
